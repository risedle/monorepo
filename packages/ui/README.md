Risedle UI is a reusable [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) component library
that help us work together to build a great experience for all of our users.

Live demo is available at [https://ui.risedle.com](https://ui.risedle.com)

### Goals

Risedle UI goals are:

1. Create reusable UI components to accelerate frontend development.
2. Create UI consistency for all components within Risedle.

> **Warning** This library is still WIP. We are actively working on it. Our
> goal is to have an easy to use UI system. This includes an exhaustive
> documentation, improved DX, confidence in testing and a lot of refactoring to
> have consistency across our components.
