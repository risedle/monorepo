# Welcome to Risedle UI

Risedle UI is a reusable [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) component library
that help us work together to build a great experience for all of our users.

## Get started

Use the following command to install Risedle UI:

```bash
# npm
npm install @risedle/ui

# pnpm
pnpm add @risedle/ui
```

Then add the following theme provider:

```ts
import { RisedleProvider, Text } from "@risedle/ui";

export default function App() {
    return (
        <RisedleProvider>
            <Text as="h1" variant="headingLarge">
                Welcome to Scaleway UI
            </Text>
        </RisedleProvider>
    );
}
```

## Methodology

Risedle UI follows the
[Atomic Design Methodology](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/).

All components are organized using the following rules:

-   **Atoms**: Atoms are the smallest building blocks of a website page. In
    atomic design, atoms refer to basic HTML elements that provide the smallest
    units of a web page, such as buttons, labels, and input fields. Fonts,
    color palettes, and animations are also considered atoms.

-   **Molecules**: Atoms are bonded together to create molecules, representing
    the second smallest groups of a website page. An example of a molecule is a
    blog subscription box made up of a field label, an input field, and a
    button.

-   **Organisms**: Organisms are groups of molecules that are joined together
    to form more complex beings. In interface terms, the organism is any design
    sequence that appears on website pages.

    The header and footer of a website page consist of two or more molecules,
    making them both organisms. The search bar is an example of a molecule used
    to build a header component.

-   **Pages**: Website pages start to take shape in the fourth phase of the
    atomic approach. Pages are groups of organisms combined to form the
    structure of a page.

## Testing

We rely heavily on jest and snapshots to ensure our components behaviour and
output are correct

### Rule of thumb

We tend towards 100% of coverage, this won't be able to cover all edge cases
and behavior but it's a good start to avoid regressions and improve confidence
in the codebase. Thus all introduced code or feature must have corresponding
test cases

### Running the tests

Every typescript files inside a `tests` folder will be executed.

```sh
$ npm run test # Will run all tests
```

### Testing behavior (click, hover, input, ...)

You can use `@testing-library/user-event` or `fireEvent` from
`@testing-library/react` to trigger events.

As stated in `@testing-library/react` documentation you should favor
`@testing-library/user-event` whenever possible
