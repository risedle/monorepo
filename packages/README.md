## Risedle Packages

Welcome to the home of all Risedle Packages!

### Versioning

All packages are managed using
[changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

To publish new version, run the following command in your local machine:

```sh
pnpm changeset
```

Follow the instruction and select only the package that you want to publish,
then commit the `.changeset` directory.

Send pull request using the following template:

If the pull request is merged, the `changesets` github action will be triggered
to automatically publish the package.
