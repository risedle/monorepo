## Contributing to Risedle Monorepo

Thanks for your interest in improving Risedle!

There are multiple opportunities to contribute at any level. If doesn't matter
if you are just getting started with Solidity, Typescript or are the most
weathered expert, we can use your help.

**No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued.**

This document will help you get started. **Do not let the document intimidate
you**. It should be considered as a guide to help you navigate the process.

The [risedle discord][risedle-discord] is available for any concerns you may
have that are not covered in this guide.

### Code of Conduct

The Risedle project adheres to the [Risedle Code of Conduct][risedle-coc]. This
code of conduct describes the _minimum_ behavior expected from all contributors.

Instances of violations of the Code of Conduct can be reported by contacting the
team at [bayu@risedle.com](mailto:bayu@risedle.com).

### Ways to contribute

There are fundamentally four ways an individual can contribute:

1. **By opening an issue:** For example, if you believe that you have uncovered
   a bug in Risedle Apps, creating a new issue in the issue tracker is the way
   to report it.
2. **By adding context:** Providing additional context to existing issues, such
   as screenshots, code snippets and helps resolve issues.
3. **By resolving issues:** Typically this is done in the form of either
   demonstrating that the issue reported is not a problem after all, or more
   often, by opening a pull request that fixes the underlying problem, in a
   concrete and reviewable manner.

**Anybody can participate in any stage of contribution**. We urge you to
participate in the discussion around bugs and participate in reviewing PRs.

### Asking for help

If you have reviewed existing documentation and still have questions, or you are
having problems, you can get help in the following ways:

-   **Asking in the support Discord:** The [Risedle Discord][risedle-discord] is
    a fast and easy way to ask questions.
-   **Opening a discussion:** This repository comes with a discussions board
    where you can also ask for help. Click the "Discussions" tab in the top.

As Risedle is still in heavy development, the documentation can be a bit
scattered. The [Risedle Docs][risedle-docs] is our current best-effort attempt
at keeping up-to-date information.
