### Get started

Welcome to Risedle Labs Monorepo!

This repository is a home of all Risedle Labs source code. We love to build on
public.

This monorepo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and
[turborepo](https://turborepo.org/).

Use the following command to install `pnpm` on your macOS:

```sh
brew install pnpm
```

See other installation method [here](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### Your Monorepomap

Looking at a bunch of directories and source codes can be intimidating
sometimes. Luckily we have provided minimap to accompany your contribution
journey:
